## Development

[Shuttle](https://github.com/shuttle-hq/shuttle) is one of the options for development of this service and it is pre-installed as part of the devcontainer.

Use [`cargo shuttle run`](https://docs.shuttle.rs/getting-started/local-run) to run the app locally:

```sh
cargo shuttle run
```

You will be able to send requests to the server using port 8000.
